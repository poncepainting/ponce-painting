              <p>
                Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer, tablet, mobile phone,
                or other device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work
                more efficiently, provide a better user experience, and give website owners
                information about how the site is being used.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (first-party cookies) or by other
                websites that provide content on the page you are viewing (third-party cookies).

              <h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
              <p>We use the following types of cookies on our website:</p>

              <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
              <p>
                These cookies are necessary for the website to function properly. They enable basic
                functions like page navigation, secure areas, and shopping carts. The website cannot
                function properly without these cookies, and they can only be disabled by changing
                your browser preferences.
              </p>

              <h3>Performance and Analytics Cookies</h3>
              <p>
                These cookies help us understand how visitors interact with our website by
                collecting and reporting information anonymously. They help us improve the
                functionality and user experience of our website.
              </p>

              <h3>Functionality Cookies</h3>
              <p>
                These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your username,
                language, or region) and provide enhanced, personalized features. They may also be
                used to provide services you have requested, such as watching a video or commenting
                on a blog.
              </p>

              <h3>Targeting/Advertising Cookies</h3>
              <p>
                These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more relevant to you and
                your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an
                advertisement and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They are
                usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator's permission.
